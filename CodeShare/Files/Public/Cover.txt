Hello, I'm an after effects editor with 7 years of experience of which 4 were spent in a professional studio. I have worked on all kinds of videos such as promotional videos, VFX Work, music videos, lyric videos, ad campaigns you can check out some of my work on my profile but that's merely Visual Effects and 3D Scenes, here's a general editing video done by me (of course this is only a lyric video but it stands to show my general editing skills and composition)

Good luck and have a great day, Angel Stojanov.
